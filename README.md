# Data Science Agent in Colab #

# how the Data Science Agent works: #
- Start fresh: Open a blank Colab notebook.
- Add your data: Upload your data file.
- Describe your goals: Describe what kind of analysis or prototype you want to build in the Gemini side panel (e.g., "Visualize trends," "Build and optimize prediction model", “Fill-in missing values”, “Select the best statistical technique”).

- Watch the Data Science Agent get to work: Sit back and watch as the necessary code, import libraries, and analysis is generated in a working Colab notebook.
# Data Science Agent benefits #
- Fully functional Colab notebooks: Not just code snippets, but complete, executable notebooks.
- Modifiable solutions: Easily customize and extend the generated code to fit your specific needs.
- Sharable results: Collaborate with teammates using standard Colab sharing features.
- Time savings: Focus on deriving insights from your data instead of wrestling with setup and boilerplate code.
